## Yunsik's Online Ruler

### Purpose
Yunsik's Online Ruler helps you measure the length and dimensions of objects when a physical ruler isn't available.

### Instructions
1. When you first visit the site, the browser will attempt to detect your display size. However, this may not be entirely accurate due to variations in physical device sizes. This may lead to the next step.
2. Click the settings button next to the display size bar. Use an object near you to calibrate the ruler on your screen. More calibration items will be added in future updates.
3. Once calibration is complete, you can start using the online ruler!

### Update Plans (sorted by priority)
1. Add responsiveness to various screen sizes.
2. Adjust the canvas size to accommodate large 2D objects (over 30 cm).
3. Introduce an inch mode for measuring 2D rectangles and circles.
4. Enable inch fractions in the input bar.
